Our dataset consists of simultaneous multimodal data collected from smart insoles equipped with CapSense (pressure) and IMU sensors, and is designed to estimate 3D ground reaction forces (3D GRFs) in a variety of sports. 
The dataset consists of time-aligned CapSense pressure data, accelerometer and gyroscope readings for the left and right foot, collected at a frequency of approximately 100 Hz. In addition, corresponding ground-truth 3D GRF measurements were obtained using a force plate, providing a comprehensive and accurate basis for training and validating machine learning models.

The dataset contains the following six human movementsï¼š
-Squatting: Execute squats by lowering the thighs until they are parallel to the ground and then standing up.
-Stepping in Place: Stepping by alternately lifting each foot while remaining in place.
-Running in Place: Running by alternately lifting each foot while maintaining a steady pace.
-Swaying Left and Right: Shift weight from one foot to the other by leaning left and right.
-Jumping in Place: Perform small, controlled jumps with both feet leaving the ground simultaneously and landing softly.
-Jumping forward and backward: Perform controlled jumps with both feet repeat forward and backward.
