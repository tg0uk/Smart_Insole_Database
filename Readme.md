## Estimation of Three-Dimensional Ground Reaction Forces Using Low-Cost Smart Insoles

Our dataset consists of simultaneous multimodal data collected from smart insoles equipped with CapSense (pressure) and IMU sensors, and is designed to estimate 3D ground reaction forces (3D GRFs) in a variety of sports. 
The dataset consists of time-aligned CapSense pressure data, accelerometer and gyroscope readings for the left and right foot, collected at a frequency of approximately 100 Hz. In addition, corresponding ground-truth 3D GRF measurements were obtained using a force plate, providing a comprehensive and accurate basis for training and validating machine learning models.

The dataset contains the following six human movementsï¼š
- Squatting: Execute squats by lowering the thighs until they are parallel to the ground and then standing up.
- Stepping in Place: Stepping by alternately lifting each foot while remaining in place.
- Running in Place: Running by alternately lifting each foot while maintaining a steady pace.
- Swaying Left and Right: Shift weight from one foot to the other by leaning left and right.
- Jumping in Place: Perform small, controlled jumps with both feet leaving the ground simultaneously and landing softly.
- Jumping forward and backward: Perform controlled jumps with both feet repeat forward and backward.

A total of five healthy adult males participated in this study, each successfully completing all six activities as outlined in the designated motion protocol. 
Each trial lasted approximately 5 minutes, with data collected at a sampling frequency of approximately 100 Hz from both the smart insole and the force plate. 
This resulted in the acquisition of around 1,600,000 paired samples for both the left and right foot across all six movements.
